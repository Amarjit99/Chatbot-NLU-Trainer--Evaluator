## Common Issues & Solutions

### Deployment Fails
âœ… Check Render build logs  
âœ… Verify all dependencies in package.json  
âœ… Ensure Node version compatibility

### CORS Errors
âœ… Verify CORS_ORIGIN matches frontend URL exactly  
âœ… Include protocol (https://)  
âœ… No trailing slash  
âœ… Redeploy backend after changes

### MongoDB Connection Fails
âœ… Check IP whitelist (0.0.0.0/0)  
âœ… Verify connection string format  
âœ… Test password (no special characters causing issues)  
âœ… Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running

### Frontend Blank Page
âœ… Check browser console for errors  
âœ… Verify VITE_API_URL is set correctly  
âœ… Check API URL uses https:// not http://  
âœ… Clear browser cache

### Free Tier Sleeping
âœ… First request after 15min takes ~30 seconds  
âœ… Consider using a keep-alive service  
âœ… Or upgrade to paid tier for 24/7 uptime

## Success Indicators

âœ… Backend health endpoint returns 200 OK  
âœ… Frontend loads and shows login page  
âœ… Can sign up, login, and create workspace  
âœ… All API calls complete successfully  
âœ… No errors in Render logs  
âœ… MongoDB shows active connections
