## üè∑Ô∏è Entity Recognition & Annotation (NER)

Use the built-in interface to annotate entities in your samples and train a lightweight, workspace-scoped entity recognizer.

### How to Use
1. Create or select a Workspace in the left sidebar.
2. Upload a dataset from the Training tab. Supported fields: `text`, `intent` (aliases like `utterance`, `label` are auto-normalized).
3. Switch to the "Entity Annotation" tab.
4. In each sample, select text, choose an entity type (e.g., PERSON, LOCATION), then click Annotate.
5. Click "Save Entity Annotations" (requires you to be logged in; token is read from localStorage as `auth_token`).
6. Click "Train Entity Model" to build a simple pattern-based NER model for this workspace.

### API Endpoints
- POST `/api/entities/save-annotations` ‚Äî saves annotations under `uploads/entity-annotations/<workspaceId>_annotations.json`.
- POST `/api/entities/train` ‚Äî trains a model using saved annotations; auto-loads from disk if memory is empty.
- GET  `/api/entities/annotations/:workspaceId` ‚Äî retrieves saved annotations.
- GET  `/api/entities/model-info/:workspaceId` ‚Äî model metadata for the workspace.

### Tips
- Ensure each item has non-empty `text` and `intent` to pass validation.
- Entity labels are uppercased automatically (e.g., `person` becomes `PERSON`).
- After server restarts, training will lazy-load saved annotations from disk.

### Troubleshooting
- "Failed to save annotations":
  - Confirm you are logged in (JWT in localStorage as `auth_token`).
  - Check backend is running on port 3001 and CORS allows `http://localhost:5173`.
  - Verify dataset rows include `text` and `intent` fields.

- "Failed to train entity model":
  - You must save annotations first for the current workspace.
  - If the server restarted, it will attempt to load `uploads/entity-annotations/<workspaceId>_annotations.json` automatically.
  - Check server logs for detailed error messages.
